This is a Tumblr theme based off the great Jekyll Octopress publishing platform. 

## Installation

Simple, just copy the contents of contessa.html into your Tumblr theme.

## Options

You can get to these options from the Tumblr theme customization page.  Its pretty straight forward.

## What is Octopress?

Octopress is [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) a static blogging system.

## Why don't you just use that instead?

I love Octopress/Jekyll, but I prefer the portability of Tumblr.  I can pretty much add content from anywhere and it becomes available instantly.  

## Why don't you submit it to the Tumblr Theme Garden?

I tried, but kept getting "Invalid Theme HTML" error.  Not worth debugging it.
