{"name":"Octopressy","body":"# Octopressy for Tumblr\r\n\r\nThis is a Tumblr theme based off the great Jekyll Octopress publishing platform. \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nSimple, just copy the contents of contessa.html into your Tumblr theme.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nYou can get to these options from the Tumblr theme customization page.  Its pretty straight forward.\r\n\r\n## What is Octopress?\r\n\r\nOctopress is [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) a static blogging system.\r\n\r\n## Why don't you just use that instead?\r\n\r\nI love Octopress/Jekyll, but I prefer the portability of Tumblr.  I can pretty much add content from anywhere and it becomes available instantly.  \r\n\r\n## Why don't you submit it to the Tumblr Theme Garden?\r\n\r\nI tried, but kept getting \"Invalid Theme HTML\" error.  Not worth debugging it.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nSome code:\r\nCopyright © 2009-2012 Josh Kerr\r\n\r\nMost of it:\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2009-2011 Brandon Mathis\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the ‘Software’), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ‘AS IS’, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
